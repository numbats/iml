# Check browser

There is a link called "Testing for doing online exam Quiz" on moodle. Check that the quiz works for you, especially that yu can see images and math equations. This is going to be the format for the final exam, and we'd love to see that your browser works well.

# Review

These are the questions from the textbook that I recommend you work through in preparation for the exam. All solutions are available at: [https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/](https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/).

In addition, if you have questions about the practice exam, you can ask your tutor. Having a general question and answer session with your tutor would be a good way to use the time.

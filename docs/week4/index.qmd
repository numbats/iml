```{r}
week <- 4
source(here::here("course_info.R"))

  filter(Week == week) |>
  mutate(ref = glue::glue("[{Reference}]({Reference_URL})")) |>
  pull(ref)
```

## What you will learn this week

* Fitting a categorical response using logistic curves
* Multivariate summary statistics
* Linear discriminant analysis, assuming samples are elliptically shaped and equal in size
* Quadratic discriminant analysis, assuming samples are elliptically shaped and different in size
* Discriminant space: making a low-dimensional visual summary

<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) produces a low-dimensional representation of a dataset.

It is an unsupervised learning method.</p>
</div>
<p>Use it, when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have too many predictors for a regression. Instead, we can use the first few principal components.</li>
<li>Need to understand relationships between variables.</li>
<li>To make plots summarising the variation in a large number of variables.</li>

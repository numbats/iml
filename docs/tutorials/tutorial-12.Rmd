# Review

## Make a game for each other

- Pick an item from the index of the textbook. 
- Write a (longish) sentence or definition that would include this word. BUT blank out the word. 
- Test your friend or classmate or tutor to see if they can work out what word would complete the sentence.
- Do as many of your classmates challenges as you can.

For example, 

> To reduce the number of variables entered into a model you can do ________ selection.

The missing word is "subset". 


## Textbook questions

These are the questions from the textbook that I recommend you work through in preparation for the exam. All solutions are available at: [https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/](https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/).

In addition, if you have questions about the practice exam, you can ask your tutor. Having a general question and answer session with your tutor would be a good way to use the time.

(1/3)\nFood servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale, they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United States) are a major component of pay.\nIn one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law the restaurant offered seating in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the server’s work schedule.\nWhat is \\(y\\)? What is \\(x\\)?"

    "text": "Books and articles\n\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)\n\nThis book by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani contains the primary content for the unit. It has the explanations for different methodology, practical labs, and a range of exercises to work through. Use the second edition, with Applications in R.\n\nHands-On Machine Learning with R\n\nThis book by Boehmke & Greenwell is an accessible and practical guide to many aspects of machine learning. It’s coverage of unsupervised classification is very good.\n\nTidy Modeling with R\n\nMachine learning is an active area of research across several disciplines, primarily statistics and computer science. Perhaps because of this there are many ways to define and fit models. The tidy modeling approach coordinates these into a consistent and understandable workflow. It doesn’t interface to all software, but getting started with machine learning using this mind-set helps you get organised despite the fragmented landscape. This book accompanies the software tidymodels.\n\nISLR tidymodels labs\n\nThis book contains the code to do most of the exercises from ISLR using the tidymodels thinking and coding style.\n\nInteractively exploring high-dimensional data and models in R\n\nThis book by Cook and Laa is the primary resource for learning how to visualise high-dimensions, how to explore the data, and to visually examine and diagnose models.\n\nInterpretable Machine Learning\n\nThis book by Christoph Molnar serves as a guide for making black box models explainable. It is an excellent resource for developing your understanding of the different types of models and how to diagnose and interpret them\n\nFeature Engineering A-Z\n\nWritten by Emil Hvitfeldt to cover creating new variables as broadly as possibly. Has classical methods such as dummy variables and box-cox transformations, temporal and spatial data and missing value imputation.\n\n\nUseful links\n\nTensorFlow for R\nA gentle introduction to deep learning in R using Keras\n(M+C)² Blog"

These are bundles of packages, and might fail at individual packages. To resolve the problems, install each package from the bundle individually, and don’t install any that fail on your system.\nIn addition, follow these instructions to set up tensorflow and keras, which requires having python installed.\nIf you are relatively new to R, working through the materials at https://learnr.numbat.space is an excellent way to up-skill. You are epsecially encouraged to work through Chapter 3, on Troubleshooting and asking for help, because at some point you will need help with your coding, and how you go about this matters and impacts the ability of others to help you.\nThe ISLR book also comes with python code, and you are welcome to do most of your work with python instead of R. However, what you submit for marking must be done with R."

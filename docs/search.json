    "text": "What type of problem is this? (1/3)\nFood servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale, they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United States) are a major component of pay.\nIn one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law the restaurant offered seating in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the server’s work schedule.\nWhat is \\(y\\)? What is \\(x\\)?"

Perhaps because of this there are many ways to define and fit models. The tidy modeling approach coordinates these into a consistent and understandable workflow. It doesn’t interface to all software, but getting started with machine learning using this mind-set helps you get organised despite the fragmented landscape. This book accompanies the software tidymodels.\n\nISLR tidymodels labs\n\nThis book contains the code to do most of the exercises from ISLR using the tidymodels thinking and coding style.\n\nInteractively exploring high-dimensional data and models in R\n\nThis book by Cook and Laa is the primary resource for learning how to visualise high-dimensions, how to explore the data, and to visually examine and diagnose models.\n\nInterpretable Machine Learning\n\nThis book by Christoph Molnar serves as a guide for making black box models explainable. It is an excellent resource for developing your understanding of the different types of models and how to diagnose and interpret them\n\nFeature Engineering A-Z\n\nWritten by Emil Hvitfeldt to cover creating new variables as broadly as possibly.

These are bundles of packages, and might fail at individual packages. To resolve the problems, install each package from the bundle individually, and don’t install any that fail on your system.\nIn addition, follow these instructions to set up tensorflow and keras, which requires having python installed.\nIf you are relatively new to R, working through the materials at https://learnr.numbat.space is an excellent way to up-skill. You are epsecially encouraged to work through Chapter 3, on Troubleshooting and asking for help, because at some point you will need help with your coding, and how you go about this matters and impacts the ability of others to help you.\nThe ISLR book also comes with python code, and you are welcome to do most of your work with python instead of R. However, what you submit for marking must be done with R."

In the lecture slides from week 1 on bias vs variance, these four images were shown.\n \n \nMark the images with the labels “true model”, “fitted model”, “bias”. Then explain in your own words why the different model shown in each has (potentially) large bias or small bias, and small variance or large variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear model will be very similar regardless of the training sample, so it has small variance. But because it misses the curved nature of the true model, it has large bias, missing critical parts of the two classes that are different.\nThe non-parametric model which captures the curves thus has small bias, but the fitted model might vary a lot from one training sample to another which would result in it being considered to have large variance.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

The sparseness of high dimensions\nRandomly generate data points that are uniformly distributed in a hyper-cube of 3, 5 and 10 dimensions, with 500 points in each sample, using the cube.solid.random function of the geozoo package. What differences do we expect to see? Now visualise each set in a grand tour and describe how they differ, and whether this matched your expectations?\nThe code to generate and view the cubes is:\n\n\nCode to generate the data and show in a tour\nlibrary(tourr)\nlibrary(geozoo)\nset.seed(1234)\ncube3 &lt;- cube.solid.random(3, 500)$points\ncube5 &lt;- cube.solid.random(5, 500)$points\ncube10 &lt;- cube.solid.random(10, 500)$points\n\nanimate_xy(cube3, axes=\"bottomleft\")\nanimate_xy(cube5, axes=\"bottomleft\")\nanimate_xy(cube10, axes=\"bottomleft\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the projections has a boxy shape, which gets less distinct as the dimension increases.\nAs the dimension increases, the points tend to concentrate in the centre of the plot window, with a smattering of points in the edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

The two big ones look like planes because they have no variation in some dimensions.\nThe second data set c2 has a triangular prism shape, which itself is divided into several smaller triangular prisms. It also has several dimensions with no variation, because the points collapse into a line in some projections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Effect of covariance\nExamine 5D multivariate normal samples drawn from populations with a range of variance-covariance matrices. (You can use the mvtnorm package to do the sampling, for example.)

PC 1 and 2 are combinations of variables 1, 2, 3 and 4, which captures this reduced dimension, and PC 3 is primarily variable 5.\nThe PCs are awkward combinations of the original variables. For d2, it would make sense to use PC1 (or equivalently and equal combination of V3, V4), and then keep the original variables V1, V2, V5.\nFor d3 it’s harder to make this call because the first two PCs are combinations of four variables. Its hard to see from this that the ideal solution would be to use an equal combination of V1, V2, and equal combination of V3, V4 and V5 on its own.\nOften understanding the variance that is explained by the PCs is hard to interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

Explain what you learn.\n\n\n\nBiplot code\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nautoplot(rates_pca, loadings = TRUE, \n         loadings.label = TRUE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the currencies contribute substantially to PC1. Only three contribute strongly to PC2: CHF, JPY, EUR. Similar to what is learned from the summary table (made in b).\nThe pattern of the points is most unusual! It has a curious S shape. Principal components are supposed to be a random scattering of values, with no obvious structure. This is a very strong pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a time series plot of PC1 and PC2. Explain why this is useful to do for this data.\n\n\n\nCode to plot PCs\nrates_pca$x |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(date = rates_std$date) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=PC1)) + geom_line()\n\nrates_pca$x |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(date = rates_std$date) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=PC2)) + geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there is a strong pattern in the first two PCs, it could be useful to understand if this is related to the temporal context of the data.\nHere we might expect that the PCs extract the main temporal patterns. We see this is the case.\nPC1 reflects the large group of currencies that greatly increase in mid-March.\nPC2 reflects the few currencies that decrease at the start of March.\n\nNote that: increase here means that the value of the currency declines relative to the USD and a decrease indicates stronger relative to the USD. Is this correct?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to drill down deeper to understand what the PCA tells us about the movement of the various currencies, relative to the USD, over the volatile period of the COVID pandemic. Plot the first two PCs again, but connect the dots in order of time. Make it interactive with plotly, where the dates are the labels. What does following the dates tell us about the variation captured in the first two principal components?\n\n\n\nCode to use interaction of the PC plot\nlibrary(plotly)\np2 &lt;- rates_pca$x |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(date = rates_std$date) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=date)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_path()\nggplotly(p2, width=400, height=400)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern in PC1 vs PC2 follows time. Prior to the pandemic there is a tangle of values on the left. Towards the end of February, when the world was starting to realise that COVID was a major health threat, there is a dramatic reaction from the world currencies, at least in relation to the USD. Currencies such as EUR, JPY, CHF reacted first, gaining strength relative to USD, and then they lost that strength. Most other currencies reacted later, losing value relative to the USD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Write a simple question about the week’s material and test your neighbour, or your tutor."

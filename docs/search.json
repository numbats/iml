The sparseness of high dimensions\nRandomly generate data points that are uniformly distributed in a hyper-cube of 3, 5 and 10 dimensions, with 500 points in each sample, using the cube.solid.random function of the geozoo package. What differences do we expect to see? Now visualise each set in a grand tour and describe how they differ, and whether this matched your expectations?\nThe code to generate and view the cubes is:\n\n\nCode to generate the data and show in a tour\nlibrary(tourr)\nlibrary(geozoo)\nset.seed(1234)\ncube3 &lt;- cube.solid.random(3, 500)$points\ncube5 &lt;- cube.solid.random(5, 500)$points\ncube10 &lt;- cube.solid.random(10, 500)$points\n\nanimate_xy(cube3, axes=\"bottomleft\")\nanimate_xy(cube5, axes=\"bottomleft\")\nanimate_xy(cube10, axes=\"bottomleft\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the projections has a boxy shape, which gets less distinct as the dimension increases.\nAs the dimension increases, the points tend to concentrate in the centre of the plot window, with a smattering of points in the edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

PC 1 and 2 are combinations of variables 1, 2, 3 and 4, which captures this reduced dimension, and PC 3 is primarily variable 5.\nThe PCs are awkward combinations of the original variables. For d2, it would make sense to use PC1 (or equivalently and equal combination of V3, V4), and then keep the original variables V1, V2, V5.\nFor d3 it’s harder to make this call because the first two PCs are combinations of four variables.

Explain what you learn.\n\n\n\nBiplot code\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nautoplot(rates_pca, loadings = TRUE, \n         loadings.label = TRUE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the currencies contribute substantially to PC1. Only three contribute strongly to PC2: CHF, JPY, EUR. Similar to what is learned from the summary table (made in b).\nThe pattern of the points is most unusual! It has a curious S shape. Principal components are supposed to be a random scattering of values, with no obvious structure. This is a very strong pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a time series plot of PC1 and PC2. Explain why this is useful to do for this data.\n\n\n\nCode to plot PCs\nrates_pca$x |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(date = rates_std$date) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=PC1)) + geom_line()\n\nrates_pca$x |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(date = rates_std$date) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=PC2)) + geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there is a strong pattern in the first two PCs, it could be useful to understand if this is related to the temporal context of the data.\nHere we might expect that the PCs extract the main temporal patterns. We see this is the case.\nPC1 reflects the large group of currencies that greatly increase in mid-March.\nPC2 reflects the few currencies that decrease at the start of March.\n\nNote that: increase here means that the value of the currency declines relative to the USD and a decrease indicates stronger relative to the USD. Is this correct?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to drill down deeper to understand what the PCA tells us about the movement of the various currencies, relative to the USD, over the volatile period of the COVID pandemic. Plot the first two PCs again, but connect the dots in order of time. Make it interactive with plotly, where the dates are the labels. What does following the dates tell us about the variation captured in the first two principal components?\n\n\n\nCode to use interaction of the PC plot\nlibrary(plotly)\np2 &lt;- rates_pca$x |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(date = rates_std$date) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=date)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_path()\nggplotly(p2, width=400, height=400)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern in PC1 vs PC2 follows time. Prior to the pandemic there is a tangle of values on the left. Towards the end of February, when the world was starting to realise that COVID was a major health threat, there is a dramatic reaction from the world currencies, at least in relation to the USD. Currencies such as EUR, JPY, CHF reacted first, gaining strength relative to USD, and then they lost that strength. Most other currencies reacted later, losing value relative to the USD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Write a simple question about the week’s material and test your neighbour, or your tutor."

Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale, they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United States) are a major component of pay.\nIn one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law the restaurant offered seating in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it.

Its measuring how much your model depends on the data you have, to the neglect of future data.\n\nIn general, the more flexible a method is, the more variance it has.\nThe size of the training data can impact on the variance."

It has the explanations for different methodology, practical labs, and a range of exercises to work through. Use the second edition, with Applications in R.\n\nHands-On Machine Learning with R\n\nThis book by Boehmke & Greenwell is an accessible and practical guide to many aspects of machine learning. It’s coverage of unsupervised classification is very good.\n\nTidy Modeling with R\n\nMachine learning is an active area of research across several disciplines, primarily statistics and computer science. Perhaps because of this there are many ways to define and fit models. The tidy modeling approach coordinates these into a consistent and understandable workflow. It doesn’t interface to all software, but getting started with machine learning using this mind-set helps you get organised despite the fragmented landscape. This book accompanies the software tidymodels.\n\nISLR tidymodels labs\n\nThis book contains the code to do most of the exercises from ISLR using the tidymodels thinking and coding style.\n\nInteractively exploring high-dimensional data and models in R\n\nThis book by Cook and Laa is the primary resource for learning how to visualise high-dimensions, how to explore the data, and to visually examine and diagnose models.\n\nInterpretable Machine Learning\n\nThis book by Christoph Molnar serves as a guide for making black box models explainable. It is an excellent resource for developing your understanding of the different types of models and how to diagnose and interpret them\n\nFeature Engineering A-Z\n\nWritten by Emil Hvitfeldt to cover creating new variables as broadly as possibly. Has classical methods such as dummy variables and box-cox transformations, temporal and spatial data and missing value imputation.\n\n\nUseful links\n\nTensorFlow for R\nA gentle introduction to deep learning in R using Keras\n(M+C)² Blog"

It says that there is substantially more variance explained by PC 1 of the womens’s track data than would be expected if there was no association between any variables.\nYou should repeat generating the multivariate normal samples and computing the variance of PC 1 a few more times to learn what is the largest that would be observed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Making a lineup plot to assess the dependence between variables\nPermutation samples is used to significance assess relationships and importance of variables. Here we will use it to assess the strength of a non-linear relationship.\n\nGenerate a sample of data that has a strong non-linear relationship but no correlation, as follows:\n\n\nset.seed(908)\nn &lt;- 205\ndf &lt;- tibble(x1 = runif(n)-0.5, x2 = x1^2 + rnorm(n)*0.01)\n\nand then use permutation to generate another 19 plots where x1 is permuted. You can do this with the nullabor package as follows:\n\nset.seed(912)\ndf_l &lt;- lineup(null_permute('x1'), df)\n\nand make all 20 plots as follows:\n\nggplot(df_l, aes(x=x1, y=x2)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(~.sample)\n\nIs the data plot recognisably different from the plots of permuted data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data and the permuted data are very different. The permutation breaks any relationship between the two variables, so we know that there is NO relationship in any of the permuted data examples. This says that the relationship seen in the data is strongly statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat this with a sample simulated with no relationship between the two variables. Can the data be distinguished from the permuted data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset.seed(916)\nn &lt;- 205\ndf &lt;- tibble(x1 = runif(n)-0.5, x2 = rnorm(n)*0.1)\ndf_l &lt;- lineup(null_permute('x1'), df)\nggplot(df_l, aes(x=x1, y=x2)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(~.sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data cannot be distinguished from the permuted data, so there is no statistically significant relatiomship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

How does this compare with variance of the first PC of the women’s track data?\n\n\n\n3. Making a lineup plot to assess the dependence between variables\nPermutation samples is used to significance assess relationships and importance of variables. Here we will use it to assess the strength of a non-linear relationship.\n\nGenerate a sample of data that has a strong non-linear relationship but no correlation, as follows:\n\n\nset.seed(908)\nn &lt;- 205\ndf &lt;- tibble(x1 = runif(n)-0.5, x2 = x1^2 + rnorm(n)*0.01)\n\nand then use permutation to generate another 19 plots where x1 is permuted. You can do this with the nullabor package as follows:\n\nset.seed(912)\ndf_l &lt;- lineup(null_permute('x1'), df)\n\nand make all 20 plots as follows:\n\nggplot(df_l, aes(x=x1, y=x2)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(~.sample)\n\nIs the data plot recognisably different from the plots of permuted data?\n\nRepeat this with a sample simulated with no relationship between the two variables. Can the data be distinguished from the permuted data?\n\n\n\n4. Computing \\(k\\)-folds for cross-validation\nFor the penguins data, compute 5-fold cross-validation sets, stratified by species.\n\nList the observations in each sample, so that you can see there is no overlap.\n\n\nMake a scatterplot matrix for each fold, coloured by species. Do the samples look similar?\n\n\n\n5. What was the easiest part of this tutorial to understand, and what was the hardest?"

Interactively explore misclassifications\nHere you are going to use interactive graphics to explore the misclassifications from the linear discriminant analysis.

This plot is linked to a tour plot. Try:\n\nSelecting penguins that have been misclassified, from the display of the confusion matrix. Observe where they are in the data space.

# Materials for ETC3250/5250 at Monash Universiy 

This repo is based on the unit_template at https://github.com/numbats/ provides a quarto template for a Business Analytics unit at Monash University. Please fork or clone this repo to create a new unit website.

It automatically deploys using github pages. So you will need to go to Settings/Pages and set the "Build and deployment" Source to "Github Actions".

For your website to appear on the numbat.space domain (e.g., as abc.numbat.space), you will need to have the CNAME record added to the DNS settings. Please ask Rob Hyndman to do this for you.
